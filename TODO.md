# Launch-blocking
- [X] Turn on competitors tracking
- [X] Too many eth_call's
- [ ] Do `performance_since_inception` and `annual_percentage_rate` calculations
- [ ] Ensure API is up while pipeline is running
- [ ] Fix negative balance issue
- [ ] All `all` support for timeframe

# Non-urgent

- [ ] Switch from QuikNode to Alchemy (can be done later)

- [X] Event replication value should be updated based on last range queried, not last observed event



# Questions

- Is pool returns the only endpoint that contains competitor data?
